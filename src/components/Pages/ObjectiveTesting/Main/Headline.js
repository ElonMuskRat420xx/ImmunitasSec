                            The Objective-Based Penetration Test is a bundle thatâ€™s offered on top of our thorough Infrastructure Penetration Testing service offering. It adds context and specific testing that makes it much more comprehensive. You set objectives (such as access to your most critical data or domain admin), and our ethical hackers will provide the attack narrative of how it was achieved. It's a comprehensive penetration test that incorporates adversary simulation.

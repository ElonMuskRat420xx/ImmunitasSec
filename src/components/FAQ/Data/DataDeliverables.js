    question: "What are the deliverables of a penetration test?",
    answer_section1:   "Pen test deliverables include a series of reports that reveal how security issues were identified and confirmed during the test to determine how the issues should be fixed. Once a penetration test has been completed, the report reveals a list of all network vulnerabilities that were discovered during the test.  In most cases, the report will also provide recommendations on how to fix the issues.",
    answer_section2:   "A typical penetration testing report will include a complete review of the project, the techniques and methodologies used during the test, security risk levels in order of priority, recommendations for fixing the issues, and suggestions for tightening up network security as a whole.",
    answer_section3:   "There is also a report for presentation to management which explains in non-technical terms how the risks can affect business continuity and potential financial losses that can be incurred as the result of a breach. This part of the report may also include the IT investments which may be necessary to improve network security.",
    answer_section4:   "The bottom line is penetration testing is well worth the investment for any SMB that wants the peace of mind knowing the network is secure and daily business operations can continue in the event of a service disruption. Penetration testing can be compared to products that are tested prior to being released on the market.",
    answer_section5:   "Automobile manufacturers test a car before releasing it on the market to ensure the vehicle is safe.  This means putting the car through simulated accident situations to ensure it will be safe in the event of a real accident.Penetration testing with regard to network intrusions works the same.  If you fail to test the security controls and network environment prior to use, it is impossible to ensure security in the event of an exploit by hackers.  This is why pen tests make sense for organisations of all sizes."

{
    question: "What Happens If I Don’t Fully Understand A Vulnerability Report Submitted By The Techincian.",
    answer_section1:   "Communication is key! You can write comments directly to the pentesters asking them to clarify a specific report. You can also write internal comments to your team members to enhance collaboration. We also know that pentest findings don’t always get fixed right away, so we allow direct communication with the pentesters for months following the completed pentest engagement.",

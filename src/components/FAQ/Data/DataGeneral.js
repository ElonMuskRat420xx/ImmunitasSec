  question: "What Is A Penetration Test?",
  answer_section1:   "Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is where you appoint a security testing company to take on the role of a hacker and attempt cyber attacks to compromise or gain unauthorised access to your network, mobile application and/or cloud environment by any means necessary.",
  answer_section2:   "Also known as white hat hacking, a qualified professional, a pen tester, will make use of penetration testing automated tools and manual processes to uncover any vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that present a cyber-security risk.",
  answer_section3:   "As a technical exercise, it involves an internal & external analysis of your IT infrastructures and applications as well as testing human elements (social engineering) therefore penetration tests should be considered a fundamental component of your risk management programme.",
  answer_section4:   "The aim of penetration testing is twofold : Identify and exploit shortcomings in the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. ",
  answer_section5:   " And should provide remediation advice and offer guidance on how to reduce the impact of the identified shortcomings being exploited."

  question: "What Are The Benefits & Why Is Penetration Testing So Important?",
  answer_section1:   "It’s recommended that businesses perform penetration tests at least annually or whenever a significant change is made to the environment. Certain compliance packages, such as PCI DSS certification, make regular penetration tests mandatory. Put simply, if you want good security, you need a comprehensive penetration test.",
  answer_section2:   "Testing your current security posture provides a clear indication on where you stand against an ever-changing threat landscape. It’s how you can efficiently identify and address vulnerabilities before an attacker does.",
  answer_section3:   "As technology evolves and your business grows, technical infrastructures become increasingly complex. It’s not uncommon for things to slip out of your control, or you might not have the relevant expertise to ensure that your controls are implemented the right way. Each test reveals the flow of your environment and any interdependencies that have a direct or indirect impact on your business security. Don’t forget that you’re only as secure as your weakest link.",
  answer_section4:   "You might think you have a very secure infrastructure in place, with all the processes, procedures and staff training to back it up. But how do you know? A penetration test is an ideal way to test your security implementations, giving you real-world proof that your security controls are up to standard and working as expected. This can be as much for the benefit of your customers’ and suppliers’ peace of mind as your own.",
  answer_section5:   "Each penetration test addresses your business risks and the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability of your data. This provides a good indication to management and the technical teams on how to best prioritise, plan, budget and remediate the risks in a structured manner."

  question: "What Are The Diffrerent Types Of Tests ?",
  answer_section1:   "There are several types of penetration testing that can be defined as either black, white or grey box testing. It’s also worth specifying there is a difference between an application test and an infrastructure test. An application test, as the name suggests, is where a tester looks for flaws within an application to see if there’s any way to get at data or manipulate functionality in a way that wasn’t intended. This can involve cookie theft, XSS, man-in-the-middle attacks etc. Infrastructure tests on the other hand are where the tester attempts to gain entrance to a corporate network.",
  answer_section2:   "Black box testing is the closest simulation of real-world hacking in that the tester will know very little, if anything about the target other than what is publicly available. These are often the least time-consuming tests as it relies solely on the tester discovering vulnerabilities in outwardly facing components. However, whilst these tests accurately represent real life situations, they will not pick up any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that may be present internally. Therefore, they cannot predict what damage an internal threat may cause.",
  answer_section3:   "White box testing offers the most thorough security test in which the tester has a full understanding of the application or infrastructure, how it works and has access from various levels. It’s likely that they’ll even have access to the source code or have a full detailed map of the internal infrastructure. The tester will probe for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to try and gain access from an external position, as well as look to see what damage can be done from an internal perspective.",
  answer_section4:   "Grey box testing is a blend of black and white box testing and is often the most popular type of test. The tester will have a limited knowledge of the target, potentially including some documentation. They will often have basic user level access, allowing for partial testing of the target’s internals.",

  question: "What Is The Difference Between A Pentration Test & Vulnerabillity Assessments?",
  answer_section1:   "The two services, whilst very different, are equally as important where cyber security is concerned. Regular vulnerability tests can be run quickly against new builds or networks on a regular (monthly) basis to allow you to patch any vulnerabilities that come to light. Leaving a single vulnerability unchecked on a single device could theoretically compromise your entire infrastructure. Whereas an annual penetration test can offer you a detailed report of your entire security posture, including your susceptibility to social engineering.",
  answer_section2:   "Just because you have had a vulnerability scan, it doesn’t mean you don’t need a penetration test. Likewise, if you’ve recently had a penetration test, it doesn’t mean you won’t benefit from a vulnerability assessment in the near future.",

{
  question: "What Can I Expect Fron The Report?",
  answer_section1:   "Upon the completion of the penetration testing main stages, the lead penetration tester will present the pen test results in a clear, comprehensive report. This report will be split into two sections: an executive summary and a technical breakdown, typically delivered within five working days after the completion of the penetration test.",

  question: "How Much Does A Penetration Test Cost?",
  answer_section1:   "The price of a penetration test can vary widely according to several factors. For this reason, there is no established price range for this type of assessment. Each project is tailored to your objectives and your technological environment. Many factors must be determined before the cost can be established.",

{
  question: "What Is The Difference Between Automated & Manual Tests?",
  answer_section1:   "Automated tests (known as Vulnerability Scanners or Vulnerability Assessments), allow IT teams to identify potential misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities within the versions of their software, operating systems and technologies.",
  answer_section2:   "While automated tests are cost effective and require less expertise to be performed, they do not yield the same level of analysis and cannot identify complex vulnerabilities (Such as logic flaws in applications, or vulnerabilities in custom-built environments). Automated tests may also cause harm to your systems and pollute your databases, so its use should be limited, complementary to manual tests and should be performed by experienced professionals to limit their negative impact.",
  answer_section3:   "Manual tests, on the contrary, requires much more expertise and a deep understanding of various technological contexts. They allow your organization to contextualize their vulnerabilities and provide evidence of their potential impact on your company. They can identify even the most subtle vulnerabilities that could potentially have a critical impact, which automated tests cannot identify, causing as little harm as possible to your systems.",

  question: "Do You Recommend Other Tests To Complement Certain Pen Tests?",
  answer_section1:   "Regular and comprehensive assessments of your cyber security are always recommended. The ramifications of security breaches can result in severe financial and reputational losses. We would always advise the safest approach for a company is to regard your cyber security holistically, weaknesses in one area may undermine security implemented elsewhere.",

  question: "Will My Business Be Disrupted During The Test?",
  answer_section1:   "Testing can be performed against a non-production replica of your live environment, such as a UAT/QA environment, to ensure no risk to your live services. If testing against production is unavoidable, we can coordinate our testing activities to minimise the impact. You can also specify things like no denial of service (DoS), meaning tests will have a negligible impact on your day-to-day operations.",

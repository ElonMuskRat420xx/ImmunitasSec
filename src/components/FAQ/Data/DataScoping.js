    question: "Does Immunias Perform Penetration Tests In A Live Environment?",
    answer_section1:   "Immunitas will always recommend the safest approach possible for your penetration test. Ideally, the tests will be performed in a testing/dev environment built with the same configurations as the targeted systems. However, our specialists have the expertise to test your systems and applications even if they are in production, without impacting your day-to-day operations.",

    question: "Can Your Tests Impact My Business Operations?",
    answer_section1:   "Various steps are taken over the course of the project to prevent the potential impact of our tests on the stability of your technological environment and the continuity of your business operations.",
    answer_section2:   "For this reason, a communication plan will be put in place at the beginning of the project to prevent and mitigate any potential impact. A representative of your organization will be identified to act as the main point of contact to ensure rapid communication in the event of a situation directly impacting the conduct of your daily operations, or if any critical vulnerabilities are identified, for which  corrective measures need to be implemented quickly.",

{
    question: "How Do You Measure The Identified Risks?",
    answer_section1:   "While we use a simple 4 levels risk rating approach (Critical, High, Moderate, Low), our risk assessment is actually based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard. Two main criteria are considered when  assessing the risk level of each vulnerability:",
    answer_section2:   " - Potential impact: The potential impact of an attack based on a vulnerability, combined with its  potential effect on the availability of the system, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of  the data.",
    answer_section3:   " - Exploitability: The potential exploitability of a vulnerability; a vulnerability that is easier to  exploit increases the number of potential attackers and thus the likelihood of an attack.  Different factors are considered when evaluating the exploitability potential of a vulnerability  (e.g.: access vector, authentication, operational complexity, etc.)",
